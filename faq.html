    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Is coaching counseling or therapy?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">No, coaching is not counseling or therapy. Counseling and therapy focus on the past and work toward healing and recovery. Coaching focuses on the present and creates the future.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Can you help me pay my bills?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">No, I am not a credit counselor nor do I offer a debt repayment program. I work with people who have the means to pay their bills and want to gain control of their finances, build confidence, and strengthen their financial position.

      <div class="faq-question">What does etiquette have to do with it?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Etiquette has everything to do with it! Good or bad, etiquette sets you apart whether it be in a social or business setting. Knowing the rules of etiquette is absolutely vital for each person who wishes to advance personally and professionally. How we speak to people, including our body language and social graces, is crucial to how we are perceived. If you lack self-confidence in this area, I can help! If you don't know the rules of business etiquette, I can work with you.

Your technical skills may be top-notch, but are your manners? To quote John Rockefeller, "I will pay more for the ability to get along with people than for any other ability."</div>
